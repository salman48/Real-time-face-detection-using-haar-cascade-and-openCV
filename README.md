# Real-Time Multiple Face Detection using OpenCV

In this project we intend to implement a Real Time Face Recognition, that can be performed in two stages such as, Face Detection and Face Recognition. In this project we implemented “Haar-Cascade Algorithm” to identify human faces which is organized in OpenCV by Python language and “Local Binary Pattern Histogram Algorithm” to recognize faces.

## Getting Started

Download the clone file of this project in your IDE project directory.

### Prerequisites

Install Packages for standard desktop environments (Windows, macOS, almost any GNU/Linux distribution) run this command in cmd. 

run >>>pip install opencv-python. if you need only main modules

run >>>pip install opencv-contrib-python. if you need both main and contrib modules 

### Installing
STEP1: - Install the IP Web Camera in your mobile phone. Start the server and copy the url, paste it your browser.

STEP2: - Copy the URL into your project (For ex. url = '192.168.0.1/shot.jpg')

STEP3: - Run face_detection.py script.

STEP4: - Run collect collect_training_data.py script.

STEP5: - Run classifier.py script a classifier.yml file will be generated.

STEP6: - Run recognize.py script for face recognition.
